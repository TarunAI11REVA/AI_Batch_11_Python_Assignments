This module contains the assignment 3 code snippets. There are two files viz.

1. basic_code_snippet.py: This file contains the basic code snippets covered in the session 3, if-else, match, while, and for loops. I have used visual studio code to implement this assignment.

2. numpy_pandas_visualization.ipynb: This file contains code snippets that uses the python libraries like numpy, pandas, and seaborn. The snippets covered are the ones implemented in session 3 during class and also some additional snippets that I have worked along and learnt on the go ! 
I have used 2 sample data csv's to implement these data munging and manipulations. These csv's are: mtcars.csv and Iris.csv.

The visuals obtained using seaborn and matplot are uploaded in the data_visuals_outputs folder.


Happy reviewing :) 

Thank you !
