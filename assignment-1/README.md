This module contains the assignment 1 code snippets. There are two files viz.

1. basic_code_snippet.py: This file contains the basic code snippets covered in the session 1, also there are valid and invalid code examples that I have also played around with the python language. The code which is invalid is commented out to avert compiler errors in the IDE. I have used visual studio code to implement this assignment.

2. coding_problems_playground.py: This file contains some basic coding problems implemented in python. This helped in realising something real as part of the session 1 learning for me. This was basically fun :) Coding problems are very basic in nature as of now, but I will definitely up the ante as we progress in the course.

Happy reviewing :) 

Thank you !
